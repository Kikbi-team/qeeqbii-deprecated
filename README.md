Qeeqbii v2.0

Project description
Think about all of the food you have eaten during the last year. Do you know for a fact if it was healthy or good for you? We believe that you could do much better, and we have a solution!

Regain control on what you eat, and become healthy again! With Qeeqbii, eating healthy is not a concern anymore. The app will warn you if you’re getting a risk eating the food that you are daily buying and alerting you when the contents of your fridge do not constitute a healthy diet. Everybody’s different, and Qeeqbii knows it: the app will give specific advices, based on all the aspects of your profile. Eat healthy again, and you’ll gain the energy to get over every challenge life puts on your path.

The app will instantly display the amount of important constituents the products you have bought contain. For example, after you scan a can of coke, an yoghurt and a pack of spaghetti, you will now know if your shopping list meets the daily requirements on proteins, salt, sugar, fat and energy.

Moreover, the app will alert you if your ration is not balanced. For example, if you eat frozen pizza often, you might lack certain elements which are contained in fruits. The app will display a message and suggest you to buy some. It will advise you to eat in a healthy way without you ever thinking about it.

Finally, the app tracks every product in the fridge you have. Each time you go to a supermarket and have a list of products to buy, you will be able to compare it to what you have in the fridge so you wouldn’t forget to buy that pasta you finished the day before! Moreover, you will be able to automatically check the item on your shopping list the moment you scan the barcode.
