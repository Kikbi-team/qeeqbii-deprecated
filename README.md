Project description: reading products barcodes to identify them and obtain its ingredients thanks to the open source OpenFood database (https://www.openfood.ch/). Identifying harmful products by comparing the ingredients with the list of cancerigen products published by the World Health Organization. Thanks to the OpenFood database, we will enable our users to identify products by scanning the barcode with their smartphone. The application makes the link between the barcode and the registered product in the database. The ingredients that compose the product will be listed on the screen with some useful health information about the harmfulness of the ingredients that the application was able to fetch from the WTO database.


Potential extensions: In a second time the App could be extended with some plugins such as

1. An allergy alert warning the user if a product contains ingredients that it is allergic to. This could be carried out thanks to the creation of a personal account that the user can use to specify the ingredients it is allergic to.

2. Proposing an alternative to the food that has been scanned. The alternative can be based on different criterions defined by the user. This criterias could be the price, the nutrients, the environmental impact, the production location, fairtrade, ...
